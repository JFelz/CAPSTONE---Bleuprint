## Overview
This application was designed to provide digital artists in the game, film, and vfx industry with the means to take control of their financial journey by discovering alternative revenue streams beyond the traditional studio dependency.

Within the 3 weeks of creation, the goal was to incorporate CRUD functionality in an exciting way while staying relevant to the consumer market. In addition, gaining more experience and deeper understanding of React, API's, databases, and UI/UX were also of top priority.
